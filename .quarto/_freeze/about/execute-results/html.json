Initially, I envisioned community as a confounder:\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](about_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nHowever, I think Community is a mediator, meaning that it is a part of the causal pathway between wealth and increased likelihood of being assigned to a prestige school. Wealth is more likely to effect the community one lives in as opposed to the reverse. The relationship is more like the following DAG:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](about_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
