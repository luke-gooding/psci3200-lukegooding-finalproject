In order to isolate the effect of attending a private primary school, I intend to control for any factors that could be considered when selecting students for the 20% list such as a student's composite score.\n\n### Community\nI chose to omit community as a control. Initially, I envisioned community as a confounder:\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](about_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nHowever, I think Community is a mediator, meaning that it is a part of the causal pathway between wealth and increased likelihood of being assigned to a prestige school. Wealth is more likely to effect the community one lives in as opposed to the reverse. The relationship is more like the following DAG:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](about_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Useful Visualization\n\n![Graph from a previous project](data/vis.png)\n\n\n\n",
